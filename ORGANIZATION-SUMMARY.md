# Project Organization Summary

## Vertical Stacking Fix Implementation

We have successfully fixed the vertical text stacking issue in PDF list rendering by implementing a bulletproof single text call approach. This approach combines prefix and content into a single string, eliminating any potential for context issues between text segments and completely resolving the issue across all test cases.

## Project Structure Organization

We've organized the project into a more maintainable structure:

### Documentation

- `/docs/fixes/` - Documentation about the fixes implemented
  - `FIX-DETAILS.md` - Technical details of the original issue and initial fixes
  - `LIST-RENDERING-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of the evolution of fixes
  - `FINAL-SOLUTION.md` - Final overview of the implemented solution
  - `README.md` - Overview of the fix documentation

### Tests

- `/src/tests/` - All test files organized by category
  - `/src/tests/list-fixes/` - Tests for list rendering fixes
  - `/src/tests/pdf-rendering/` - Tests for PDF rendering functionality
  - `/src/tests/utils/` - Utility tests
  - Each directory has an `index.js` for running all tests in that category

### Generated Files

- `/output/` - Directory for generated PDFs from tests

### Scripts

- Added test scripts to `package.json`:
  - `npm test` - Run all tests
  - `npm run test:list` - Run only list fix tests
  - `npm run test:pdf` - Run only PDF rendering tests
  - `npm run test:utils` - Run only utility tests

## Next Steps

1. Update import paths in all test files to account for their new locations
2. Continue development of additional features:
   - Table support for Markdown
   - Image embedding capability
   - Custom header/footer options
   - Enhanced theming capabilities

## Benefits of the New Organization

- Improved maintainability with logical grouping of files
- Better testing structure with organized test categories
- Comprehensive documentation of fixes and solutions
- Cleaner root directory without test-generated files
- Simplified test running with npm scripts
