- Support common document formats
- Simple API interface

### 2. PDF Manipulation Service

- Basic PDF operations
- Merge/split functionality
- Page manipulation

### 3. Storage Service

- Document storage
- Version control
- Access management

### 4. API Gateway

- Request routing
- Authentication
- Rate limiting
