# PDF Rendering Fix Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation about the fixes implemented for PDF rendering issues in the PDF microservice.

## List of Documents

1. `FIX-DETAILS.md` - Technical details of the original issue and initial fixes
2. `LIST-RENDERING-FIX-SUMMARY.md` - Summary of the evolution of fixes for list rendering
3. `FINAL-SOLUTION.md` - Final overview of the implemented solution

## Key Issue Fixed

The main issue addressed was the **vertical text stacking** problem where list items would display with each character on a separate line instead of flowing horizontally. This made documents unreadable and unusable.

## Solution Approach

After multiple iterations, we implemented a bulletproof solution using a single text call approach that combines the list prefix (bullet/number) and content into a single string. This approach eliminated any potential for context issues between text segments and completely resolved the issue across all test cases.

## Testing

We created comprehensive test suites to verify the fix:

- `tests/list-fixes/` - Tests specifically for list rendering issues
- `tests/pdf-rendering/` - Tests for the full PDF rendering pipeline
- `tests/utils/` - Utility tests including font-specific tests

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only list fix tests
npm run test:list

# Run only PDF rendering tests
npm run test:pdf

# Run only utility tests
npm run test:utils
```
