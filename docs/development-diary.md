## **🔍 Technical Decisions**

### **🔑 Authentication Strategy**

**Decision**: _API Key-based authentication with middleware._  
**Rationale**: _Simple to implement, sufficient security for a microservice, easy integration with n8n and other platforms._  
**Alternatives Considered**:

- ❌ _OAuth2 – Too complex for MVP microservice_
- ❌ _JWT Authentication – More overhead than needed for simple microservice_  
  **Implementation Notes:** _API key stored in environment variables, validated via middleware._

### **🔑 PDF Generation Approach**

**Decision**: _PDFKit with custom Markdown renderer._  
**Rationale**: _PDFKit offers low-level control needed for formatting, custom renderer allows precise control over Markdown features._  
**Alternatives Considered**:

- ❌ _Puppeteer/HTML to PDF – More resource-intensive_
- ❌ _wkhtmltopdf – External dependency, harder to deploy_
- ❌ _Ready-made Markdown-PDF libraries – Less control over formatting_
  **Implementation Notes:** _Modular architecture with separate rendering and metadata utilities._

## **🐞 Debugging Journal**

### **🛠 Issue: Port Binding on Render (2024-07-25)**

🛑 **Problem**: _Service not starting due to incorrect port binding on Render._  
🔍 **Investigation Steps**:  
1️⃣ Checked logs – **Found port binding error**  
2️⃣ Examined code for port configuration – **Needed to listen on 0.0.0.0**  
3️⃣ Updated port binding in server startup code – **Added hostname parameter**  
✅ **Solution**: _Modified server.listen to use 0.0.0.0 as hostname and process.env.PORT for the port number._

### **🛠 Issue: n8n Integration Body Format (2024-07-29)**

🛑 **Problem**: _n8n HTTP requests not generating PDFs correctly._  
🔍 **Investigation Steps**:  
1️⃣ Checked request format in n8n – **Found incorrect body structure**  
2️⃣ Examined API expectations – **Required "content" field was missing**  
3️⃣ Updated n8n workflow – **Fixed HTTP request body format**  
✅ **Solution**: _Configured n8n HTTP request node to properly format the request body with the required "content" field._
